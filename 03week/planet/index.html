        The White House announced Tuesday that President Trump will continue a 2014 Obama-era order protecting LGBTQ employees who work for federal contractors from workplace discrimination. The announcement came after reports that an executive order affecting
        the LGBTQ community was coming. "President Donald J. Trump is determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the LGBTQ community," the statement obtained by ABC News said. "The President is proud to have been the first ever GOP nominee
        to mention the LGBTQ community in his nomination acceptance speech, pledging then to protect the community from violence and oppression." The Trump administration has vowed to undo many Obama-era policies, and had been weighing the 2014 order
        prior to making this decision, according to the Associated Press. Human Rights Campaign (HRC), an outspoken opponent of the Trump administration, told the Associated Press that they were not satisfied with the White House's announcement. "[Trump]
        has left the key question unanswered —- will he commit to opposing any executive actions that allow government employees, taxpayer-funded organizations or even companies to discriminate?" HRC President Chad Griffin told the Associated Press.</article>
