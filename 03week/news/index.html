        A 2006 Crosbyton graduate has acheieved moderate success with a well known technology company. It all started here among the dust-covered South Plains, he had an interest in computers and a desire to one day move far away. First there was a coding boot
        camp, then there were the multiple interviews because the job market was so great upon his graduation. He made his decision based upon future growth and benefits provided. When pressed by relatives on when he might be coming back for a visit he
        answered "probably sometime around Thanksgiving."
