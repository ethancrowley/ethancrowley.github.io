            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I grew up in a small west Texas farming town called Crosbyton (about 40 miles east of Lubbock). After high school graduation I moved to Lubbock, but never really felt at home there. After the birth of my son in 2008 it was decided that I would make my way to Austin. I attended Texas State Technical college in Waco and earned my associates which landed me a job at Samsung Austin Semiconductor. For a while life was good but I soon realized that I was not in the profession that I wanted to be in. I thought long and hard about what I enjoyed throughout school and I remembered that class which a farmer's wife taught on HTML and how much I enjoyed it. I then decided to challenge myself by enrolling in Austin Coding Academy and start a new life.   </p>

            <h3>Why I am learning to code</h3>
            <p>Since I took a simple HTML class in high school I've always wanted to code. Life happened pretty fast after high school, and I ended up with a decent job, it just wasn't what I wanted to do. I want to code because I believe it is the future, and I want to constantly be challenged. </p>
